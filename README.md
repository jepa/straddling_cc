# Project Goal:

Identify straddles between the high seas and EEZs and investigate the effects of climate-induced distribution shifts on the sharing of straddling stocks.

i) which stocks straddle between the high seas and global EEZs 

ii) weather climate change will affect the proportion of the distribution between EEZs and the high-seas.

# Files and folders organization:

In this repository you will find all of the code related to the manuscript. Note that the code needs to compile data from external sources. Due to the large volume of data, these are not in GitHub. See Data Availability below.

# Data Availability 
The raw data used in this analysis comes from different sources including OBIS, GBIF, The Sea Around Us, and FishBase, among others. These can be sourced directly from their respectively webpages and/or the references provided on the text. The data containing the identification of transboundary species per eez and fishing nation and the catch trend of each taxon per eez can be found here.

## Support data

Support data used in this project is called along the *methods* section of the `main_analysis.Rmd` script. Note that these data were used in building the final result and most of them (i.e., relevant) are included in the primary data. These are used in the *results* section.

### Species related data
